## Case Study : Refrigerator
### Refrigerator takes real time input of temperature from the freezer and makes decision in order to maintain the temperature in the particular range. The door sensor senses the position of the door in order. LED's turn ON if the dorr is open and turns OFF if the door is closed.

# Component Description
## Power Supply
- To power all the components, an external power supply is used.

## Switch Buttons
- To either power the system or isolate the system, switches are used.

## LEDâ€™s
- LED's act as a mean to communication with the user

## Microcontroller
- Performs all operations required by our system. Takes temperature as input and maintains cooling system for a particular range of temperature.

## Door Sensors
- To turn on the lights when the door is kept open.

## Temperature Sensors
- To determine the temperature of the freezer. 

## LCD Display
- To show Temperature readings

## ADC
- Converts the Analog signal from Potentiometer to Digital.

## Clock
- For Synchronization

## Compressor
- A compressor in a refrigeration system is used to circulate the refrigerant throughout the system, and at the very same time it is used to raise the temperature of the refrigerant above the condensing media such as either air, water or natural convection so that the condensation should take place.

## Actuators
- Externally connected devices that perform operation as per the decision which the microcontroller takes.

# V - Model
## Concept of Operation 
- Refrigerator takes real time input of temperature from the freezer and makes decision in order to maintain the temperature in the particular range.

## Low Level Requirements
- Switches to turn ON/OFF the system
- Power Supply to the Microcontroller, Sensors and Actuators

## High Level Requirements
- To detect the Temperature of the freezer using temperature sensors
- To detect the position of the door.
- To make decisions whether to increase or decrease the temperature of the freezer.

## Test Cases
- Are the decives receiving power supply? (Y/N)
- Are the sensors working fine? (Y/N)
- Is the decision made by the microcontroller to increase or decrease the temperature is correct? (Y/N)
- Is the LED turning ON when the door is open and turning OFF when the door is closed?(Y/N)
